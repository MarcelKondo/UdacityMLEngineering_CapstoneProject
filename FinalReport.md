## I. Definition

### Project Overview
As one of the fastest growing industries in present years, the gaming scenario has seen a surge of interest almost never seen before, with worldwide competitions taking place in gigantic stadiums, crouds comparable to those of football matches, and viewers in massive quantities not only physically but also virtually through webstreams throughout the whole world. With audiences as massives as those, the ability to provide in-game statistics, and further commentaries on what they represent for the performance of the team or player, is an important aspect to develop. However, with games getting more and more complicated, with mechanics that involve increasingly more detailed information, this task has become quite difficult to be done by human commentators all by themselves - and therein lies a possible application for machine learning methods to aid them.

### Problem Statement
The problem which this project is aimed at tackling is the Kaggle competition "PUBG Finish Placement Prediction", in which we have to try and predict the final placement of numerous players in one round of the famous FPS title "Player Unknown's Battle Ground", by analising data 
realated to their score throughout one round (such as kill count, assists, damage dealt, etc). 

  As we have at our disposal a collection of over 65000 games' worth of anonymized player data, consisting of their score data + their final placement, this problem is a well suited application for supervized learning algorithms, and I plan to test and compare the performance of 3 different algorithms (described in the Solution Statement) in that category.

### Metrics
The metric to be used to evaluate the performance of the algorithms is the one defined by the competition rules: Mean Absolute Error (MAE).

MAE score is defined as the mean of the absolute value of the real minus predicted values of each row in the validation/test data sets: 1/n sum(abs(each_predicted_y-each_real_y))) The advantage of MAE (other than being a contest requirment) is that it provides a simple measurement of the error of a prediction that disregards the sign of the error and doesn't over-emphasize outliers.


## II. Analysis

### Data Exploration
In this section, you will be expected to analyze the data you are using for the problem. This data can either be in the form of a dataset (or datasets), input data (or input files), or even an environment. The type of data should be thoroughly described and, if possible, have basic statistics and information presented (such as discussion of input features or defining characteristics about the input or environment). Any abnormalities or interesting qualities about the data that may need to be addressed have been identified (such as features that need to be transformed or the possibility of outliers). Questions to ask yourself when writing this section:
- _If a dataset is present for this problem, have you thoroughly discussed certain features about the dataset? Has a data sample been provided to the reader?_
- _If a dataset is present for this problem, are statistics about the dataset calculated and reported? Have any relevant results from this calculation been discussed?_
- _If a dataset is **not** present for this problem, has discussion been made about the input space or input data for your problem?_
- _Are there any abnormalities or characteristics about the input space or dataset that need to be addressed? (categorical variables, missing values, outliers, etc.)_

### Exploratory Visualization
In this section, you will need to provide some form of visualization that summarizes or extracts a relevant characteristic or feature about the data. The visualization should adequately support the data being used. Discuss why this visualization was chosen and how it is relevant. Questions to ask yourself when writing this section:
- _Have you visualized a relevant characteristic or feature about the dataset or input data?_
- _Is the visualization thoroughly analyzed and discussed?_
- _If a plot is provided, are the axes, title, and datum clearly defined?_

### Algorithms and Techniques
In this section, you will need to discuss the algorithms and techniques you intend to use for solving the problem. You should justify the use of each one based on the characteristics of the problem and the problem domain. Questions to ask yourself when writing this section:
- _Are the algorithms you will use, including any default variables/parameters in the project clearly defined?_
- _Are the techniques to be used thoroughly discussed and justified?_
- _Is it made clear how the input data or datasets will be handled by the algorithms and techniques chosen?_

### Benchmark
In this section, you will need to provide a clearly defined benchmark result or threshold for comparing across performances obtained by your solution. The reasoning behind the benchmark (in the case where it is not an established result) should be discussed. Questions to ask yourself when writing this section:
- _Has some result or value been provided that acts as a benchmark for measuring performance?_
- _Is it clear how this result or value was obtained (whether by data or by hypothesis)?_


## III. Methodology
_(approx. 3-5 pages)_

### Data Preprocessing
In this section, all of your preprocessing steps will need to be clearly documented, if any were necessary. From the previous section, any of the abnormalities or characteristics that you identified about the dataset will be addressed and corrected here. Questions to ask yourself when writing this section:
- _If the algorithms chosen require preprocessing steps like feature selection or feature transformations, have they been properly documented?_
- _Based on the **Data Exploration** section, if there were abnormalities or characteristics that needed to be addressed, have they been properly corrected?_
- _If no preprocessing is needed, has it been made clear why?_

### Implementation
In this section, the process for which metrics, algorithms, and techniques that you implemented for the given data will need to be clearly documented. It should be abundantly clear how the implementation was carried out, and discussion should be made regarding any complications that occurred during this process. Questions to ask yourself when writing this section:
- _Is it made clear how the algorithms and techniques were implemented with the given datasets or input data?_
- _Were there any complications with the original metrics or techniques that required changing prior to acquiring a solution?_
- _Was there any part of the coding process (e.g., writing complicated functions) that should be documented?_

### Refinement
In this section, you will need to discuss the process of improvement you made upon the algorithms and techniques you used in your implementation. For example, adjusting parameters for certain models to acquire improved solutions would fall under the refinement category. Your initial and final solutions should be reported, as well as any significant intermediate results as necessary. Questions to ask yourself when writing this section:
- _Has an initial solution been found and clearly reported?_
- _Is the process of improvement clearly documented, such as what techniques were used?_
- _Are intermediate and final solutions clearly reported as the process is improved?_


## IV. Results
_(approx. 2-3 pages)_

### Model Evaluation and Validation
In this section, the final model and any supporting qualities should be evaluated in detail. It should be clear how the final model was derived and why this model was chosen. In addition, some type of analysis should be used to validate the robustness of this model and its solution, such as manipulating the input data or environment to see how the model’s solution is affected (this is called sensitivity analysis). Questions to ask yourself when writing this section:
- _Is the final model reasonable and aligning with solution expectations? Are the final parameters of the model appropriate?_
- _Has the final model been tested with various inputs to evaluate whether the model generalizes well to unseen data?_
- _Is the model robust enough for the problem? Do small perturbations (changes) in training data or the input space greatly affect the results?_
- _Can results found from the model be trusted?_

### Justification
In this section, your model’s final solution and its results should be compared to the benchmark you established earlier in the project using some type of statistical analysis. You should also justify whether these results and the solution are significant enough to have solved the problem posed in the project. Questions to ask yourself when writing this section:
- _Are the final results found stronger than the benchmark result reported earlier?_
- _Have you thoroughly analyzed and discussed the final solution?_
- _Is the final solution significant enough to have solved the problem?_


## V. Conclusion
_(approx. 1-2 pages)_

### Free-Form Visualization
In this section, you will need to provide some form of visualization that emphasizes an important quality about the project. It is much more free-form, but should reasonably support a significant result or characteristic about the problem that you want to discuss. Questions to ask yourself when writing this section:
- _Have you visualized a relevant or important quality about the problem, dataset, input data, or results?_
- _Is the visualization thoroughly analyzed and discussed?_
- _If a plot is provided, are the axes, title, and datum clearly defined?_

### Reflection
In this section, you will summarize the entire end-to-end problem solution and discuss one or two particular aspects of the project you found interesting or difficult. You are expected to reflect on the project as a whole to show that you have a firm understanding of the entire process employed in your work. Questions to ask yourself when writing this section:
- _Have you thoroughly summarized the entire process you used for this project?_
- _Were there any interesting aspects of the project?_
- _Were there any difficult aspects of the project?_
- _Does the final model and solution fit your expectations for the problem, and should it be used in a general setting to solve these types of problems?_

### Improvement
In this section, you will need to provide discussion as to how one aspect of the implementation you designed could be improved. As an example, consider ways your implementation can be made more general, and what would need to be modified. You do not need to make this improvement, but the potential solutions resulting from these changes are considered and compared/contrasted to your current solution. Questions to ask yourself when writing this section:
- _Are there further improvements that could be made on the algorithms or techniques you used in this project?_
- _Were there algorithms or techniques you researched that you did not know how to implement, but would consider using if you knew how?_
- _If you used your final solution as the new benchmark, do you think an even better solution exists?_
